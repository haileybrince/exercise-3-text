        There are two documents in this exercise to help you learn to format text using semantic markup. HTML is "semantic" and most tags communicate the meaning and/or structure of the content that they are marking up. For instance, the &lt;p&gt; or paragraph tag creates a paragraph of text. A paragraph is "a distinct section of a piece of writing, usually dealing with a single theme and indicated by a new line, indentation, or numbering." The browser indicates the paragraph element by causing it to display on its own lines, with new lines that separate it from the paragraphs above or below.
